			<h1>About Thomas</h1>
			<p>I was born in Chicago, Illinos in early 2000. I have an older sister and a younger brother. I started off my schooling at the Lycee Francais de Chicago, where I stayed until 1st grade, after which I transferred to FW Parker and finally The Latin School of Chicago in 6th grade, where I stayed through high school. After high school, I went to Amherst College in Massachussetts, where I am currently in my second year studying computer science and political science with a focus in international security. </p>

			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I was born and rasied in Chicago, Illinos a couple blocks north of Wrigley Field. I have an older sister and a younger brother. I started off my schooling at the Lycee Francais de Chicago, where I stayed until 1st grade, after which I transferred to Francis W. Parker and finally The Latin School of Chicago in 6th grade where I stayed through high school. After high school, I went to Amherst College in Massachussetts, where I am currently in my second year double majoring in computer science and political science with a focus in international security.</p>
